A Dominican and English fusion.  A Northern English brown ale made with tamarind fruit.  The English Brown provides a base beer with malty flavor and aromas of toffee and chocolate as well as some fruity esters.  The tamarind fruit provides a sourness with dark plum notes.  In the end, a sweet and sour tasty fusion.
