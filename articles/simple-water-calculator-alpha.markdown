Title: Simple Water Calculator

A few months ago I got interested in the water chemistry of brewing, a subject at I have always avoided. When I first started brewing I would add some Gypsum every now and then not really knowing what it did, or how much to use.  

I believe the turning point for me was a

a friend of mine (Sean Patronis) shared with me of a talk on the subject by John Palmer.
After some more research I figured out why I always had problems with water calculators I have used in the past, they try to match water profiles instead of the effect of the water profile.  

Other water calculators I have seen take in the salts to add and then show how close you are to a target profile along with showing any warnings for high ion levels. For my most common scenario this is not very helpful.  Instead I would like to enter information on the beer I am brewing which I know without any chemistry knownledge and have the calculator provide me with the salts to add.  So after feeling that I had learned enough I set out to build one.

## The Water Calculator

There are two factors to a water profile I am interested in: Residual Alkalinity (RA) and the Chloride to Sulfate Ratio.  Both of these factors can be roughly determined from the beer style.  A proof-of-concept version of my water calculator is below.  A lot of work still needs to be done, but I have already found it quite useful for my last few brews.

<div class="simple-water-calculator">
	<div style="text-align:center;color:#55a;margin:1em 0;">Using Tallahassee Water</div>
	<div>
		<label>Volume of Water to Adjust (gallons)</label>
		<input name="volume" type="text" size="5" value="14" />
	</div>
	<div class="water-selection"></div>
	<div class="sliders">
		<div class="slider-info srm-slider-info ui-helper-clearfix">
			<div class="srm-value"></div>
			<div class="ra-value"></div>
			<div class="srm-color"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="slider srm-slider"></div>

		<div style="height:50px;"></div>

		<div class="slider-info ratio-slider-info ui-helper-clearfix">
			<div class="value"></div>
			<div class="description"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="slider malt-balance-slider"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="result">

	</div>
</div>

<script id="waterProfileForm" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl">
	<form>
		<label></label>
		<input>
	</form>
</script>

To use the calculator enter the about of water you need to treat, then select the beer color you are brewing using the top slider and then select the bitter/malty balance of your brewing water with the next slider. As you change the input parameters the CaSO (Gypsum) and CaCl (Calcium Chloride) amounts to add are adjusted below.


## Planed Improvements

The current state of this calculator is pretty rough.  There are many bugs I need to fix when I get the time along with many features I want to add.  Here is a list of what I am currently planning to add:

1. latic acid adjustments
1. allow decreasing RA with Calcium Carbonate adjustments
1. Magnesium Sulfate adjustments for low levels of Mg
1. high ion level warnings
1. custom starting water profile
