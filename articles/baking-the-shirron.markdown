Title: Baking the Shirron

When it comes to avoiding infections in my beers I have been very fortunate thought out my brewing history.  Until a few months ago that is.  I dumped ten gallons of sour (in a bad way) beer for the first time, that hurt but it was beyond saving. Unfortunately in a following batch the same exact thing happened, it even tasted similar to the earlier infection. I was able to "save" the batch by not letting sit in the fermenter too long and using gelatin to help settle out all of the suspended particles which helped the flavor out quite a bit.

After having the same infection happen twice I started inspecting all of my equipment, looking for the possible causes to the infection.  It didn't take me too long to focus in on my plate chiller as I had eliminated almost all other variables after it happened the first time.

## No, Not my Plate Chiller

I own a Shirron Plate Chiller that I have been quite happy with.  The major flaw with it, and any other consumer grade plate chiller I have found, is that you can not dissemble it to properly clean it out.  I was about ready to stop using it and resort to an immersion chiller or even start going the no-chill method when I heard about baking the plate chiller to sterilize it. I am happy to say that I have now brewed thirty gallons of beer without any sign of infection.  It is one extra step I have on brew day, but it is well worth it to me if I can keep using my plate chiller!

## Procedure
1. Rinse and fully drain the plate chiller
2. Wrap tinfoil around the ports of the chiller to avoid messes from residual liquid that might splash out
3. Place the chiller in an oven preheated to __350F__ for __60 minutes__
