Title: Results of Clarifying with Gelatin

Clear beer is a big deal to me.  I know for a lot of home brewers cosmetics is not a factor, but I have to say it is for me.  Every since the first beer I brewed I have wanted it to be clearer faster (OK, maybe not the first, but the second; my first was a stout). Filtration is very alluring to me and I have dreamed about for some time. The problem I have with it is the price.  From what I can find the filters are expensive and can only one or a few times.  For this reason filtation has not been a viable option for me.

I have used Irish moss in the past, but I as far as I can tell the end result is pretty much the same.  More recently I have learned that Irish moss works by helping some of the proteins in the wort, hot break I presume, participate out.  That explains why the finished beer still took weeks/months to clear.  After the hot break there is still the cold break and even more importantly yeast and anything else that might get suspended in the beer.  

## Using Gelating to Clear Beer – not Wort

Gelatin can be used to clear beer too.  I have heard about this in passing from other brewers, but have always thought of the partial effectiveness of Irish moss and similar products.  However after looking more into gelatin, it works after fermentation unlike Irish Moss.  Gelatin not only clears the hot break proteins but also yeast and other post fermentation suspended particles.

I have a beer I brewed recently that was mildly infected from a wild yeast during fermentation which caused it to be very hazy, along with some other off flavors.  This is the beer that really got me interested in gelatin as the beer was not going to clear itself in an acceptable time period.  

Refer to Clearing Beer with Gleatin for the instructions on the procedure I used.

##Result of Gelatin

I am very happy with the results of gelatin in for this beer.  Below is a picture of the difference after 24 hours.  The clarity has greatly improved.

##Flavor Results

Gelatin even goes beyond cosmetics, as important as I think it is.  I have found the flavor of the beer has improved as well.  I was hoping for this effect after researching about gelatin and am happy to find it to be true.  By pulling all of the yeast and other particulate out of suspension many of the off flavors I didn't want in my beer have been removed.

Since I have a 10 gallon system, I have two kegs full of the same beer.  I only added gelatin to one of them so that I would have a good control example.  Both kegs are side by side in the same kegerator, and kegged at the same time.  I gave the disadvantage to the control keg. I have been drinking from it for a week which will help give it some clearing effects over the other.

Since I have an obvious bias toward which beer I like the most, I put together a blind taste test consisting of my wife Denise Howard my brother Joshua Howard and my best friend and soon to be certified beer judge Sean Patronis.  I gave them both beers, one cleared with gelatin and one with no finishings and asked them for tasting notes.

### Tasting Notes from Denise Howard

I am very impressed with my wife on this one; her palette much better than mine.  Without even knowing about the beer I was asking her about and not being a beer nerd like me, her responses seemed to almost scripted. 

Question: What do you taste from this beer?

- **Gelatin cleared beer**: “It taste crisp and refreshing.  I taste some matlyness and a little hops.”

- **Control keg**: “It taste sweet.  I also taste some fruitiness”

OK, I am super impressed with my wife now, I am pretty sure I would not have been able to so clearly differentiate the beers like that without all of the brew nerd lingo I have learned over the years.  She was right on and her responses seemed to almost scripted.  

The gelatin pulled the wild yeast out of suspension, it certainly wasn't US-05 I added that tasted fruity when fermenting at 65 degrees Fahrenheit that she tasted!  The sweetness she picked up on is interesting.  This wild yeast seems to leave what I would refer to as a “sickly sweet” taste along with a over powering bittering flavor.  I am thinking the “hops” she was tasting was some what from that. However I did add Columbus Hops for bittering and the alpha acid level was much higher than I had planned, 14.6A%. Along with the sweetness I also pickup some plastic flavor I I feel are related.  From my testing this phenolic flavor was also removed by the gelatin.
